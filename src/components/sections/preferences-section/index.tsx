                Even though I am a full-stack developer I have always preferred working with
                frontend web technologies. React, or something related such as NextJS are my
                preferred tools for web-based applications. For websites that are mostly static,
                like this website, I tend to use something simpler such as Vite and vanilla JS/CSS.

            <p>Ultimately it depends on feature requirements.</p>
        </PageSection>
