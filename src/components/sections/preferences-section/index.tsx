                Even though I am a full-stack developer, I have always preferred working with
                frontend web technologies. React, or something related such as NextJS, are my
                preferred tools for web-based applications. Ultimately, it depends on the
                requirements though. For small, static websites, I tend to reach for Vite and
                vanilla JavaScript and CSS.

        </PageSection>
    )
}
