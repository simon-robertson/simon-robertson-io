                Welcome to my personal website. This is a new website and is still evolving, I am
                aiming to add code related articles and experimental apps/tools over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a senior software developer (web) with a passion for creating interesting or
                innovative web-based applications. I keep myself up to date with web technologies
                whenever I can, and I have plenty of experience with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, React,
                NextJS, Vercel, and a number of other technologies such as Vue, Solid, Vite, and
                Node. I am able to take an idea and develop it through to a production release.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can also work with backend programming languages and have a good amount of
                experience with PHP, Laravel, and Go. I am trying to forget Java. When it comes to
                databases, I am comfortable with Mongo and SQL based databases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sprints, sprint planning, standup meetings, stakeholder meetings, epics, stories,
                tasks, working within teams, and leading teams are all things that I am comfortable
                with.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a big fan of large language models (GPT is a good example), not for their
                code completion abilities, but for their potential to improve user experience within
                web applications.
