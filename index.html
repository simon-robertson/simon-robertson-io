					<h1>Hello</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					Welcome to my personal website. This is a new website and is still evolving, I
					am aiming to add code related articles and experimental apps/tools over time.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am a senior software developer (web) with a passion for creating interesting
					or innovative web-based applications. I keep myself up to date with web
					technologies whenever I can, and I have plenty of experience with vanilla
					JavaScript, CSS, React, NextJS, Vercel, and a number of other technologies such
					as Vue, Solid, Vite, and Node. I am able to take an idea and develop it through
					to a production release.
				</p>
				<p>
					I can also work with backend programming languages and have a good amount of
					experience with PHP, Laravel, and Go. I am trying to forget Java. When it comes
					to databases, I am comfortable with Mongo and SQL based databases. One of my
					favourite database services is Turso which is built around SQLite.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sprints, sprint planning, standup meetings, stakeholder meetings, epics,
					stories, tasks, working within teams, and leading teams are things I am
					comfortable with.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am also a big fan of large language models (GPT is a good example), not for
					their code completion abilities, but for their potential to improve user
					experience within web applications. The OpenAI API is very good.

					<h1>Preferences</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					Even though I am a full-stack developer I have always preferred working with
					frontend web technologies. React, or something related such as NextJS are my
					preferred tools for web-based applications. For websites that are mostly static,
					like this website, I tend to use something simpler such as Vite and vanilla
					JS/CSS.
				</p>
				<p>Ultimately it depends on feature requirements.</p>

					Here are a few quotes from recommendations on LinkedIn that I have received from
					people I have worked with.

						I had the opportunity to collaborate with Simon on two projects, his modesty
						only underscores his impressive technical expertise. <br /><br />
						Simon's deep understanding of both front-end and back-end development truly
						makes him a standout software developer. His ability to navigate complex
						concepts with ease is remarkable, and he consistently delivers efficient and
						high-quality work. I can say he did not [steal] the Senior label of his
						title.

						I had the pleasure of working alongside Simon during my time at Shift:
						initially as part of his team before moving on to run my own. While a part
						of Simon's team I was continually impressed by the manner in which he
						coordinated the completion of complex tasks while continuing to be a major
						individual contributor. As a fellow lead I was impressed at the ownership
						and responsibility Simon demonstrated for features and their translation
						into value delivery for the wider team and the company as a whole.

						Simon led a small team with exceptional skill, ensuring that we consistently
						delivered high-quality products and maintained impeccable coding standards.
						His attention to detail, combined with his ability to anticipate challenges,
						meant that we were always ahead of the curve when it came to delivering
						innovative solutions.
						<br /><br />
						What truly sets Simon apart, however, is his collaborative spirit and
						willingness to go above and beyond. He was always the first to step in when
						issues arose, offering help to fix bugs and resolve challenges, regardless
						of the scope. His support extended far beyond his immediate
						responsibilities, contributing significantly to the overall success of the
						company.
